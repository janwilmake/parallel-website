# About

The world wide web is built for humans using browsers and apps. Soon, the web will be used primarily by AIs on our behalf. While people typically search and discover common information with a limited number of access patterns, AIs can unlock immense value from the long-tail of specialized knowledge on the web. As a result, access and computation on the web will increase by several orders of magnitude. Everything from the infrastructure to business models will need to evolve.

At Parallel Web Systems, we are bringing this new web to life: itâ€™s built with, by, and for AIs. Our work spans innovations across crawling, indexing, ranking, retrieval, and reasoning systems. Our first product is an API for AIs to execute high-value repetitive tasks using web data.
